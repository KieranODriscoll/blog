- Looking over someone's shoulder to obtain information from someone
- Surprisingly easy
	- Airports/Flights, Hallway-facing monitor
- Can also surf from afar, using binoculars/telescope
- Prevent shoulder surfing
	- Control your input, be aware of your surrounding
	- Use privacy filters, making it only visible to the person sitting directly in front of it
	- Keep your monitor out of sight, away from hallways and windows
