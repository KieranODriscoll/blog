# Effective social engineering
	- Constantly changing, never know what trick they will use next
	- May involve multiple people
	- May happen in person or electronically
	- Automate tools for open source intelligence, helping with gathering the information
# Social engineering principles
## Authority
	- The social engineer acts like they are in charge, and coming from a place of authority. Office of the CEO, Police, etc
## Intimidation
	-Something bad will happen if you don't help.
		- Pay won't be processed, etc
## Consensus / Social proof
	- Convinced based on what's normally expected
	- So and So helped me last week
## Scarcity
	- The situation will not be this way for long
	- Must make a change before time runs out
## Urgency
	- Act quickly, don't think
	- This must be done right away
	- Works alongside scarcity
## Familiarity / Liking
	- Someone you know, we have common friends, etc
## Trust
	- Someone who is perceived safe.
	- “I'm from IT”
