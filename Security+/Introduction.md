This section will contain my study notes related to the Security+ exam

# Resources

The following resources will be used
- [Professor Messer Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8)
- [Professor Messer Study Notes](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-601/sy0-601-video/sy0-601-comptia-security-plus-course/)
- I will add more as I come across them

Throughout this whole process, I will be adding notes based off of Professor Messer's notes and videos. When it comes time to start studying and doing practice exams, if an area is particularly tricky, I will add further notes to the subject.

Credit to Professor Messer for the great notes and videos on the Security+ Exam.
