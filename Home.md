# Hello World

My goal is to use this site as a way to brain dump things I run into in the tech world. Whether that is self-hosting, home assistant or other things I have learned.

One major aspect of this blog will be to document my journey into cybersecurity, whether that is [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com) or [TryHackMe](https://www.TryHackMe.com) walkthroughs, notetaking / documenting learning experiences of certificates or anything else related to cybersecurity.

In terms of my cyber journey, I come from a background of software development with a sprinkle of intro to cybersecurity mixed in. So while this won't be 0 to hero, it will start from a relatively junior/low-intermediate level.

Great to have your here on this journey! :)
